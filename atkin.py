This is the most modern alogorithm that I plane to implement
This sieve was created in 2003 by A.O.L. Atkin and Daniel J. Bernstein
'''

'''                         ALGORITHM
1. Create a list of [2, 3, 5]
2. Create a list of integers up to some limit we define as n
3.

hmmm I want to understand this sieve better before implementing it

import math

# returns the list of primes up to n
# These primes are found by by Atkins's Sieve
def atkin(n):
    pass
    # if n < 2: return []
    # if n < 3: return [2]
    # if n < 5: return [2, 3]
    # primes = [2, 3, 5]
    # numbers = range(1, n + 1)
    # for n in numbers:
